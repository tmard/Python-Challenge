## Python-Challenge

Entering the world of programming with Python.



# Background


Application of Python programming for two real-world scenarios.  




# Methods

PyBank

•	A Python script was developed to analyze the financial records of the company. 
•	The script was to analyze records and calculate the following:
o	Total number of months
o	Net total amount of “Profit/Losses” over the entire period
o	Changes followed by the average “Profit/Losses” over the entire period
o	Greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over entire period
o	Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over entire period


PyPoll

•	A Python script was developed to modernize its vote counting process
•	The script was to analyze the votes and calculate the following:
o	Total number of votes cast
o	Complete list of candidates who received votes
o	Percentage of votes each candidate won
o	Total number of votes each candidate won
o	Winner of the election based on popular vote



Both the PyBank and PyPoll printed the analysis to the terminal and exported a text file to the appropriate file folder with the results. 



The repository was initially created on GitHub, cloned to my computer, and once all the appropriate directories, file folders and appropriate files were created, these changes were then pushed back to GitHub.
